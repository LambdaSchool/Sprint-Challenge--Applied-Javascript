### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

DOM stand for Document Object Model. It is the "tree" created by the connection of different Nodes (or elements) to their parent and child Nodes in an HTML document.

2. What is an event?

An event can come in many forms, such as 'click' or 'mouseover', keyboard or input events. They are assigned to DOM elements through event listeners, tell them which event to look for before invoking an assigned action.

3. What is an event listener?

Event Listeners are assigned to DOM elements and wait to perform an assigned action or invoke a code block when a certain event takes place on that element.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Nodelists are array-like, but converting them to arrays allow developers to use methods like .map() and .forEach()

5. What is a component? 

Components are pieces of code that are used to build elements sharing functionality. They keep code readable and DRY so that the same block doesn't have to repeated.
