### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component? 

1. DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. 
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

2. An event is how js interacts with html. They can be user generated, like mouse clicks or generated by programs such as api's. 
It is basically a change in the DOM caused by a user or an api.

3. An event listener is a method used to capture events. The application is setup to respond to these events.

4. NodeList is only array like. Which means it doesnt have access to all the methods that an array does.

5. Component is a modular piece of software. It is supposed to be able to stand on its own. It is a piece of software that can
be reused in other applications with no modification  or very little modifications. For example, i wrote an application for a 
finance company. One of my coworkers requested that i make it modular because he wanted to be able to take the software and sell
it to other companies and have it function with no modifications.
