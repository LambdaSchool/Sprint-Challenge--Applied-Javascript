### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

DOM is Document Object Model, it reads the HTML and prepares it for your browser. It is a tree like structure.


2. What is an event?

An event is when "something" happens. It can be something like a mouse click or a wheel scroll.

3. What is an event listener?


An even listener is how the browser "listens" for events, so it is keeping an eye out for those mouse clicks and wheel scrolls and will respond as appropriate if there is javascript for it.


4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Converting to an array makes the data easier to handle in some cases. It will allow us to use things such as .map.

5. What is a component? 

Components are bits of reuseable code. So instead of having button1 button2 button3 etc and lots of repeating code, you can just have a button component once that you manipulate. It helps you keep your code DRY.
