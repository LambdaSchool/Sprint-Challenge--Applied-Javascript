### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

DOM is a cross platform api that treats HTML as a tree structure representing each object as a node.

Any active functionality after the page being loaded such as mouse click's, key press's, etc.

3. What is an event listener?

Gives the html ears so to speak, which will respond via method whenever triggered by a user, ex; Button click.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

This will allow for the HTML to load faster and allows us to access all the nodes within that Array throughout the whole file.
