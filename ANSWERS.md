### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    It is a way for programs to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a page. It allows you to directly contact the document which holds all of the HTML for your web page and in turn manage that data.
2. What is an event?
    An event is something either the user or browser do. For a user this might be when they click on something, and for the browser it may be when it finished loading.
3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is function that is only activated when the event it is set to detect occurs, where it will then run anything inside it.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    It isn't possible to iterate through a nodelist with array functions, so it's a lot more efficient and effective to convert it.
5. What is a component? 
    A component is a part of a site that adds functionality to it, so one component may be tasked with making something into a dropdown, while another has to make an image carousel possible.
