    An event is anything that happens in the browser. A few examples of this would be mouse movements, clicks, resize window and scroll.

3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is a peice of code that is assigned the job of looking for a specific event to occer on a specific object or on the website in general. It allows us to manipulate the page only after a specific event occurs, like a click. 

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
