### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is a language-independent programming interface that treats HTML as a tree structure. Each object is representing a part of the document.

2. What is an event?

An event is an interaction with HTML when a user interacts with the page.

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener is something the event type listens for. When set, the event listens for the specific set function to fire. (IE: 'click', 'mouseover', etc.)

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

A NodeList is 'Array-like'. It does not have all the methods that an Array has. By converting, it gives us more functionality with the Array.

5. What is a component? 

A component is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript brought together for reuse in a website or application.
