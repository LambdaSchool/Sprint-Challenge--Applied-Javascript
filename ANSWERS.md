### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    Document Object Model
    It represents a live page that has processed HTML and CSS that represents the documents structure. The DOM is something that can be manipulated live and changed using Javascript to allow for more interaction between the user and the website/web application
2. What is an event?
    Events are interactions that are programmed to provide interaction in the webpage when an action delivered by the user is performed.
3. What is an event listener?
    Event listener communicates with the DOM and shows that when a button for example is clicked it will signal the code to perform the action associated with the event listner.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    Nodelist is not an array and doesn't have all functionality of an array such as mapping. So conversion takes place and constructor objects can be created for event listeners 
5. What is a component? 
    Component is a JS class that contains properties, declarations, and event handlers. They are used primarily to prevent repetitive code.
