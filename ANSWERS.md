### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

The DOM refers to the document object model which, at its fundamental levels, allows websites to understand multiple languages.  The DOM itself is a sort of stand-in for the document that holds the content for a webpage.  This allows manibulation of the features and function of the page through the use of other programming languages, such as JavaScript.  The DOM is related to the API, Application Program Interface.  API can be thought of as the combination of/interaction between the DOM and a scripting language.  

2. What is an event?

In the context of web-development, an event can be thought of as any action a user take when reading/interacting with a webpage.  This could be, clicking, scrolling, hovering, minimizing etc. 

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener is a tool a dveloper can use in order to track or respond to the actions a user takes when interacting with a webage.  This could take the form of a change in the appearance or content of an element on the page that happens when a user clicks or hovers over an item.  An event listener can also refer to a logging of user activity which would be accomplished through the use of console logging what a user does.  The results of the console.log would appear in the "console" of the developer view of the page. 


4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Arrays have many built-in properties and methods.  Methods, especially, can be capicalized upon in order to accomplish certain tasks on a webpage.  For example, mapping over multiple elements which we would like to have similar properties or functions requires the input to be formatted as an array.  We convert from node-lists to arrays in order to access these useful properties and methods.

5. What is a component? 

In web dvelopment, a component refers to the combination of html, CSS and Javascript.  In isolation, these tools are restricted to their own unique domains, but collectively, they can accomplish useful tasks.  We saw an example of this when we built a tab navigation into a site.  The HTML provided the content, the CSS gave use the styling and the javascript was reponsible for the functionality (responses to user activity).  I recently watched "The Incredibles".  I'm thinking a componenent is analagous to the super heroes combining their powers in order to defeat the bad guy -- a task they could not do alone!
