### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
  The DOM is the Document Object Model, and it includes everything inside the document (not the window). All elements are objects of the DOM.
2. What is an event?
  An event is something the user does (click, mouseover, keypress, etc.)
3. What is an event listener?
  An event listener listens for an event to happen and then initiates a behavior.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array
  To access Array methods on the NodeList like .map().
5. What is a component?
  I'm still trying to understand what exactly a component is, but my understanding is that they are reusable pieces of code that perform actions on the DOM?
