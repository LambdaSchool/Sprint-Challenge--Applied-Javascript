### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model which is created by the browser when a webpage loads. The DOM is essentially a tree of objects that corresponds to the HTML structure, and those objects can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript (other languages can also do this but JS is the standard). This opens the door to dynamic interfaces that have behavior and the ability to create experiences based on how the user interacts with the page as opposed to a static HTML page in which the user is an observer vs an active participant.
