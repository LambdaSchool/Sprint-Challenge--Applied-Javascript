### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model: it represents the skeleton (HTML) of the webpage. It's a tree structure that allows us to manipulate its branches and the nodes on those branches to build a more interactive webpage and write DRY code.

2. What is an event?
An event is every interaction a user has with a website.

3. What is an event listener?
When an event happens on an element, we can add an event listener to trigger an action. 

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
To have access to more methods.

5. What is a component? 
A resuseable piece of code that can build elements that have the same style and function. Again, keeping our code DRY.
