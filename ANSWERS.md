### Questions:

1. What is the DOM?
   The DOM, or the Document Object Model, is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements and CSS styling in a structure that is rendered by a web browser. The DOM allows us to manipulate the elements and styling of each node in the structure.

2. What is an event?
   An event is an interaction that is captured by the browser. Events are usually user driven like clicking on something or moving the mouse but there can also be programmatic events like when a page loads.

3. What is an event listener?
   An event listener is a method that captures whenever an event occurs. It is a function that can be added to an HTML element that takes in as argument the name of the event and a callback function.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
   An Array has many methods available that are used to manipulate and iterate over the data within the array that are not available in a Nodelist.

5. What is a component?
   A component is a re-usable element that has properties and methods associated. Components are written by declaring a class and defining the properties and methods. These are instantiated and assigned to the DOM as HTML elements.
