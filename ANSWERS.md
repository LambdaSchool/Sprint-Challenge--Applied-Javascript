### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
Document Object Model-Is what users can see after the app first loads, any action that the user takes will affect the DOM and not the HTML file.
2. What is an event?
Any action that the user can perform on the DOM, like click, hover, scroll, etc...
3. What is an event listener?
Is when we assign a task to our app in any element that is waitting for an event to take place and then it will perform that task.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
To use any other array method that is not forEach and make sure our changes take place on every item within the array.
5. What is a component? 
Is like a class when we assign properties and methods to a group of elements that are related to each other and share this properties and methods, so everytime we need to create a new method we don't have to assign this properties and methods individually, we just create a new instance of that class and it will automatically share properties and methods.
