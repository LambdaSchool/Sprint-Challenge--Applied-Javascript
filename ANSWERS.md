4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

converting a nodelist into an array gives us access to all the methods we would have for arrays. 


5. What is a component? 
a component is html,css, & javascript used in a way that it is reusable. So that if we were to say add or take away buttons or articles from a page they styling and other features would work regardless and nothing would break.
