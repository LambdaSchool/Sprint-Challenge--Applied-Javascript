4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Because a NodeList does not have a lot of methods on it's own so we convert it into an Array in order to get access to more methods and properties.

5. What is a component? A component is a section of a website that involves HTML, CSS & JavaScript together to function properly. This components code can be reused as they are all tied in together.
