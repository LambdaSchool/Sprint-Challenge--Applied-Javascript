### Questions:

1. What is the DOM?
The document object model(DOM) is an API that parses the HTML into nodes which can then be manipulated by Javascript.

2. What is an event?
An event is any action that the user has done such as clicking, pressing a key, scrolling, and etc.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener listens for an action then runs a callback once the action has been committed.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

A nodelist has fewer methods than an array. We would want to convert the NodeList to an array because the map method with conjunction of inserting the items one by one into a class, lets you build fully interactive elements.

5. What is a component? 
A component is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
