### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is made from a webpage's HTML by the browser, but it also allows us to manipulate it locally with javascript.

2. What is an event?
An event occurs whenever an user scrolls, clicks or otherwise does something on a website. The browser tracks these events, and can respond to them through javascript and the DOM.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener detects the occurrence of an event. This is needed so that we can respond to an event.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
We can't iterate over a NodeList in javascript, but we can iterate over an array.

5. What is a component? 
Components are snippets of code that can be used in different projects, making workflow faster and more efficient.
