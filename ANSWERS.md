### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component?

### Answers:
1. The DOM is the rendering of the HTML we write that gets displayed on the page.
It looks like the HTML because its rendered from it, but it is its own separate
element.
2. Any interaction that a user has with the webpage: a click, a scroll, a
mouseover/leave, typing, keystrokes, etc.
3. A methods that picks up on events and, when triggered, executes a script/
callback function.
4. To be able to use the Array methods. NodeLists are great, but they don't
have nearly as much methods available as Arrays do.
5. A reusabe block of code. We write these when we'll be using the same
functionality/design over and over, this way we can access it by calling it
instead of re-writing it over and over.
