### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent API that treats an HTML document as a tree structure in which the nodes are objects representing parts of a document.
2. What is an event?
When using Javascript to interact with HTML, events occur when a user or the browser changes a page. When a page loads it's called an event, when a button is pressed it's an event etc. 
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a case-sensitive string that represents an event type. The object that uses a event interface is notified when the event occurs. The object must use an EventListener or function to achieve this. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
While both NodeLists and HTMLCollections are DOM nodes, they have different methods and different types of nodes. A NodeList may contain any type of Node, however, an HTMLCollection may only contain element nodes. NodeLists are considered array like, but do not have the same methods as a array. 
5. What is a component? 
A component is a reusable set of HTML, Javascript, and CSS used for UI or API.
