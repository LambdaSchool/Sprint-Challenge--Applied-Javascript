### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

	The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
	It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
	The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

2. What is an event?

	JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.
	When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event.
	Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

3. What is an event listener?

	You can set specific functions to run when the user performs an event.
    These functions "listen" for an event and then initiate the function.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

	So we can use Array methods.

5. What is a component?

	Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling.
