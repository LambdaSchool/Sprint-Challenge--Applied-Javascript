### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

Document Object Model; the way an internet browser reads your code basically.

2. What is an event?

An event is pretty much any user input the computer can process.

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener checks for a specific type of event to occur on a specified object.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

because the nodelist doesn't have all the build in methods an array does.

5. What is a component? 

unsure; my best guess would be a new object created inside a class creator.
