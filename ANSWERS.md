### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model allows the JS, HTML, and CSS of a webpage to work together and creates a tree-like model of all the elements on the page that explains how each element can be altered to affect another.

2. What is an event?
an event occurs when a user of a webpage 'does something' that causes the functionality of the page to react with a JS coded event; I.E. loading a webpage, clicking on the screen, etc.

3. What is an event listener?
an event listener is attached to a specific element in the HTML, and causes an event to happen when that element is manipulated.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
A NodeList does not have the same functionality as an Array.

5. What is a component? 
Elements on a webpage are 're-usable' by grouping the styling and functionality together, and thus creating a component.
