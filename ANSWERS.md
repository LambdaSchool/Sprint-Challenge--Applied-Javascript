### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? stands for Document Object model and represents a document and is represented by treeview ot nodes,which represent doem object in the document
2. What is an event?can be anything such as user interaction or app notification, and is used by the DOM to make identify things of interest
3. What is an event listener? captures events such as mouse click and performs some sort of action
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? nodelists are not traditional arrays so they must be converted to something javascript can manipulate through using the map function, which is a transform operation
5. What is a component? reusable code , that I would equate similarly to an application plugin
