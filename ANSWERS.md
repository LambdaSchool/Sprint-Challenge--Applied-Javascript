### Questions:

1. What is the DOM?
   The DOM is the document object model and allows us to make our webpages interactive using JavaScript. Each element in the DOM is represented as an object, and we can manipulate those objects using JavaScript.

2. What is an event?
   Events are actions that happpen on a webpage when something specific happens, like clicking on a button, or resizing the window.

3. What is an event listener?
   An event listener attaches to an event and waits for that event to happen, then does something when the event occurs.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
   NodeList returns an array-like object, so we do not access to all of the normal array properties and methods. Turning a NodeList into an array allows us to use all of those array propeties and methods.

5. What is a component?
   A component is a reusable block of code that can be used over and over on dynamic websites.
