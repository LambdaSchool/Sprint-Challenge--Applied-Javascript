### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The document object model. It's an interface that represents everything on the page as nodes so that we can interact with and manipulate it. 
2. What is an event?
Any number of things that could happen on a website, from a user clicking somewhere to an animation finishing to load status of the window.
3. What is an event listener?
A function that listens for a particular event and once it detects it, runs a callback.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
To take advantage of array methods that don't exist for node lists, like .map and .filter.
5. What is a component?
A component is a chunk of reusable builder code that can take pieces from the dom (or create them) and put them all through the same process.
