### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
Answer: The Document Object Model, or DOM, refers to the object representation of html elements that compose a webpage. It allows us to interact and manipulate these elements so that we may change document styling, structure, and content.

2. What is an event?
A: An event is simply every interaction a user has with a site. Whether it's filling out a contact form, a mouse click, scrolling of the page, etc, all of these count as events.

3. What is an event listener?
A: Event Listeners are no more than specific elements that have been programmed by us to fire a callback function when specific events have occured.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
A: It's all based on functionality. NodeLists are array-like but lack the methods provided by arrays such as forEach, map, filter, and many more.

5. What is a component? 
A: Components are reusuable pieces of code that can be used for building elements that share functionality and style.
