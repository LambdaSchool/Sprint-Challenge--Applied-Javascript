### Questions:
## What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure where in each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree.


## What is an event?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.


## What is an event listener?
An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur; that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or interrupt. The listener is in effect a loop that is programmed to react to an input or signal.


## Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
To better manipulate the NodeList


## What is a component?
Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.
