### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is the browser's breakdown of the HTML on a page into an object representation that's a tree-like structure that has parent elements and nested child elements. The HTML file along with CSS is broken down to create a model of what the page should look like and do. The DOM can be manipulated to change the appearance and behavior of a page locally without changing the actual HTML or CSS.

2. What is an event?

An event is an interaction of the user via mouse, keyboard, scrollbar, etc with the page. The DOM creates an event object and its propogation allows something to happen on the page in response to the interaction, such as a meny dropping down or a pop-up window appearing.

1. What is an event listener?

An event listener "listens" for a specific user interaction/event, such as a click, and takes in a callback which is enacted when the event happens.

2. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Converting a NodeList to an Array allows us to use methods that are specific to arrays such as .map, .filter, and .forEach.

3. What is a component? 

A component is reusable code that is used to create elements with the same functionality and properties. This helps us avoid repetition and be more efficient. Components involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
