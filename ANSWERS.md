### Questions:

3. What is an event listener?
    A method that watches for a specific event on a specific element so that it can trigger a callback function.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    Nodelist has a limited amount of methods so it is converted into an Array so that it has the whole Array library available to manipulate the data.

5. What is a component? 
    Independent pieces of code that are responsible for one action. These are easily reusable and have a shared functionality and style so they can't be used easily throughout a design.
