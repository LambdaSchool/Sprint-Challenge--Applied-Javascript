### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?  Document Object Model, which allows different programs and languages to interact as it is an object oriented representation of the webpage.  this allows us to access and manipulate it dynamically with a language like javascript. 
2. What is an event?  an event is basically when something happens to an HTML element, whether it is something the browser or user does, like the page loading or a button being clicked. 
3. What is an event listener?  an event listener registers when an event has occurred.  we can write these using methods to get information about how a site is being used and functioning. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?  nodelist is only "array like" so it does not have all of the functionality of an array in an object oriented language, so if we would like to analyze this information in more depth it can be helpful to convert it so we can run higher order functions on it. 
5. What is a component? components are reusable blocks of code with encapsulated functionality that will prevent conflicts.
