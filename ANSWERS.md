### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
DOM stands for the Document Object Model. It's an interface that is live and can be used to access and change things in the window.

2. What is an event?
An event can be attached to a node which basically listens for when something, that the user does, happens, which then occurs.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener can be attached to an object or node that listens and waits for something to happen, thus triggering an event (such as click or scroll event).

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
We would convert a NodeList into an Array so that we can map over it. This allows class and constructor functionality to be implemented. We can't map over a NodeList, so it must be an array.

5. What is a component? 
A component is a set of features that can be used and reused to manipulate a webpage.
