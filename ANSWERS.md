## What is the DOM?

>  DOM is Document Object Model. It is not your HTML however it will look just like your HTML. When using the dom you can see a tree like structure inside your devtools that is a visual representation of the DOM.  The browser reads your HTML and turns it into the DOM.



## What is an event?

> As we know an event is something that has happened. In Javascript this is the same principle. If a user clicks on a piece of HTML or CSS it creates an event. Meaning I clicked so something has happened. 



## What is an event listener?

> We know that an event can be a toggling, click, or even a hover over an object. The event listener is bascially like a person listening or watching for the click, toggle, or even the hover to happen.  It is way to see if something has happened. 


##  Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

> NodeList are a way of getting multiple objects from the DOM. But it doesnt give us too many  features to work with. We can only use one type of loop to rationalize the data. Which is not alot of options. If we can try and make an item into an Object like Array then it gives us many more features like map, filter, push, pop and theres more to chose from. This makes the data manipulation a lot easier to deal with on a larger scale.



##  What is a component? 


> Components are readable and reusable and dry code. Now what does this mean. Take for instance a button on a webpage. If you have one button it really just a button. But if you have multiple buttons on page and it creates some content on a page. It is consider a component. Almost like pieces of a engine to a car. A carborator is a component for the engine. So is a gas tank. In this essence what ever helps create the over all site to running is consider a component.
