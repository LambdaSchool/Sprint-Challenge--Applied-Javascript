### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model is a Javascript Object that organizes all of our page's elements into nodes in a tree structure. We can use the DOM in the browser to interact with web pages in real time, making debugging and experimentation a much smoother experience. We can also use DOM properties and methods to access and manipulate our HTML using Javascript.

2. What is an event?
An event refers to a user's interaction with a web page, such as clicking an element, scrolling up or down, dragging and dropping an element, etc.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener "listens" for a specific type of event (such as a click on an image) and calls a function when that event occurs.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Converting a NodeList to an array gives us access to array methods on the NodeList items.

5. What is a component? 
A component is a collection of elements that have very similar functionality or styling. Working with components allows us to apply the same functionality to all elements in a collection with much less code.
