		moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or interrupt. The listener is in effect a loop that is programmed to react to an input or signal.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

		methods like .map(), .filter().... so need to convert Array-like into Array.

		heart of any dynamic web application and Javascript framework.
