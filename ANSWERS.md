### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model, Basically an interface that renders and interacts with HTML, and can be changed with Javascript

2. What is an event?
An event can be many things, any action that you want to listen for.  i.e. clicks, mouseenter and mouseleave, scroll, key presses etc.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener "listens" for those events, and allows you to make something happen when that event occurs

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Because a NodeList is an "array like" object. it does not share the prototype with Array.  You convert it to an array to be able to use array methods on it

5. What is a component? 
Components are basically classes that allow us to add funtionality to our pages, while being efficient with our code.  You can create a Class and apply those effects to multiple items on the page, and can automatically add that funcionality to HTML elements that you add.
