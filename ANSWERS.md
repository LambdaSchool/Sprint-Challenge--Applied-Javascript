### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? The Document Object Model, an object representation of the html elements of the webpage.
2. What is an event? Events are interactions between the user and the site (ie: click, scroll, pressing a key, etc).
3. What is an event listener? An event listener can be assigned to an element, and when the event happens (click, scroll, pressing a key), a callback is fired.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? A NodeList is an 'array-like object,' which means that it has access to some of the Array methods (zero-based index, length property, and forEach). If we wanted to do anything else to the NodeList, like .map over the items, or .reduce, the NodeList would need to be converted into an Array.
5. What is a component? A reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements that share function and styling.
