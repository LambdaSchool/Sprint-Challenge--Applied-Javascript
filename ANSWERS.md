### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
	Is what ties Java Script, HTML, and CSS/LESS all together and renders it. I like to think of it as a superfical illusion cast over the "source code" that is Js, CSS and HTML.
2. What is an event?
	An event is something that is alive; like a click that does something, or a scroll that makes something happen.
3. What is an event listener?
	Is the point in the code that if this condition is met, then this will happen. It is the spring in the trap. The waiting match to spark to the fires blaze.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
	Becasue Arrays have a bunch of methods to them, that allow us a heck of alot more room to manipulate the data with. while NodeList only have like..5 methods.
5. What is a component? 
	Components are rusable code machines that make our lives easier.
