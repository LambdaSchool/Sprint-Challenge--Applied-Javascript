### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model and it represents a webpage as a hierarchy 
of nodes which are essentially objects that be manipulated by JavaScript(and other languages) to modify a 
webpage to create things like dynamic interactions.
2. What is an event?
An event is an object that represents something that has occurred(e.g mouseclick, element
manipulation, keyboard operations, progress status of a specific task). Events can be used to trigger 
various operations on the DOM.
3. What is an event listener?
Event listeners are functions that handle specific events to perform specific operations. Multiple event listeners can 
be set up on a particular event.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Converting a Nodelist into an Array allows us to use array functions on things like instances of a class as native 
nodelists have limited methods(forEach, length, item, entries, keys, values).
5. What is a component? 
A component is an element that shares common functionality and features. Components allow
the incorporation of elements with consistent behavior and attributes and are very useful
when appending new elements to the a webpage.
