### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The full name for the DOM is the Document Object Model. The DOM is created from the HTML of the webpage and is stored in a tree structure that allows us to access and manipulate parts of the DOM as we like that are immediately displayed on the webpage. We never directly edit the HTML file that is loaded, we edit the Javascript DOM object and that's how our changes are displayed on the screen.

2. What is an event?
An event is an interaction we're having with an HTML element. Some types of events are 'click', 'mouseover', 'mouseenter', 'mouseup', 'wheel' etc. There is a full list of events that can be found on MDN and other sites. Events can notify of things such as basic user interactions or alerts of things happening.
