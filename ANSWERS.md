### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model, which details the node structure of the html webpage. It is created everytime a browser renders the webpage, and it allows for manipulation of the html elements through javascript, since it is a client  side language.
2. What is an event?
Events are user defined actions that can occur on a webpage, which can trigger functions if javascsript was used to setup the appropriate event handlers. Apparently javascript is an event driven programming language, and here I thoguht it was just poorly designed?
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is javascsript method that can be set to target specific dom elements to watch for user based interations, an example is the click event handler.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
To allow for manipulation through the array methods.
5. What is a component?
A component is a bloc of javscript code usually tailored to a specific region of a webpage, that exploits DOM manipulation in order to update the webpage using javscript in an extensible fashion, because of the  emphasis on writing DRY code. Bootstrap.js is a bunch of componenets for example.
