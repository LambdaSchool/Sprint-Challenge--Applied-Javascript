### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
DOM = Document Object Model refers to all elements of a web site, including accessible models, methods, and the information contained in the HTML code. It also gives access to things that are not already set in the HTML - for example, adding a class to an HTML object. The best way I can describe it is: it is the skeletal system of a web page.

2. What is an event?
An event is whatever the user does while on a web page. It could be a mouse movement, a click, hovering over an item, loading or leaving a page, a key press, or many other things.

3. What is an event listener?
The event listener is the javascript method that allows access to the user's events, which can allow javascript based reactions to what the user does.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Converting a NodeList into an array allows the use of array methods like forEach, map, reduce, filter and others.  This allows us to change the elements that were in the NodeList.

5. What is a component? 
Components are smaller pieces of code that can be re-used in multiple applications.
