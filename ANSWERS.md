### Questions:
1. The DOM stands for the "Document Object Module". The DOM allows us to manipulate and access the HTML and CSS, creating changes in our browser LIVE.

2. An event is considered when a user interacts with your website or app in a certain way. An event could be the user clicking on links or scrolling through the site.

3. An event listener is a sort of identifier for when a user makes a SPECIFIC event. If the event listener is looking for a specific interaction(event), and the user does the event, the event listener modifies the page according to the code its been given.

4. You would convert a NodeList into an array because NodeLists are restricted to a very limited amount of methods. But since a NodeList is an array-like object (something thats almost an array), we can transform it into an array, giving it a vast amount of methods and other capabilities.

5. Components are chunks of code that can be reused in parts of an application that are similar (things such as button interaction, and tab interaction). Components really make up small parts of your application that are can be implemented elsewhere later on, keeping code DRY.
