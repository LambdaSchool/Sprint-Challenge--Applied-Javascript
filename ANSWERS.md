### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model is an object representation of the HTML elements of a webpage. It gives us an interface with which we can interact with and manipulate the page, changing the document structure, content, and styling.

2. What is an event?
Every interaction a user has with a site is known as an event: a click, mouse movement, page scroll, keyboard press, etc...

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a callback function that identifies when an event has been triggered.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
When we convert a NodeList to an array, it allows us to use the methods .forEach, .map, etc. This allows us to manipulate the DOM more thoroughly with regard to the content on the page.

5. What is a component? 
Components are reusable sections of code that can be used to build larger elements that share functionality and styling. They are the heart of many modern web apps and frameworks.
