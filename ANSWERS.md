### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model, which contains nodes such as Window, Document, HTML, Head, Body, etc. Each node is represented so it can be accessed and changed through scripts.
2. What is an event?
An event is a user action on an element, such as a mouseover, a click, a scroll, or a key press.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a function that will wait for a specified event to take place on a specified element, then perform some action(s).
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
NodeLists cannot be mapped over, but arrays can. We want to map over the array of nodes to create `new` objects.
5. What is a component? 
A component is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and behaviors that is usually reusable.
