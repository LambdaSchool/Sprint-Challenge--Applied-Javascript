### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM allows us to change the HTML from our Javascript by treating the HTML as a document.

2. What is an event?

An event is when something happens on screen, ususally due to user interaction.

3. What is an event listener?

The event listener is the action that must be done that will cause the event to be called (clickin, scrolling, refreshing the page). There is also some sort of function that will cause the actions to take place on screen.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Because while NodeLists are like arrays, they do not have access to array methods. You need to convert if you want to use these methods.

5. What is a component? 

Components are reusable pieces of Javascript that keep your code from being redundant (DRY). It can also make it easier to edit your webpage later one.
