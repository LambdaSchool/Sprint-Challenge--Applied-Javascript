### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

Answer: The DOM is the Document Object Model - it is a property of the global Window.Object. It is separate from HTML and CSS and allows us to add functionality and styling to our website (i.e., works like in-line styling)

2. What is an event?

Answer: An event is anytime a user interacts with our website (i.e., click, using their mouse to browse, refresh a page)

3. What is an event listener?

Answer: An event Listener is a method that we run in javascript that allows our site to take any user 'event' and react to it. An event listener is a method that takes two parameters - a user action (i.e., 'click') and a function that executes code.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Answer: A NodeList is array-like, but not exactly an Array, so it doesn't have access to Array methods. We convert it into Array so that we can use Array methods on it (i.e., map).

5. What is a component? 

Answer: A component is re-usable code that allows us to keep our Code DRY and Modular. It's generally made up of instances of a Class, with it's own properties and methods.
