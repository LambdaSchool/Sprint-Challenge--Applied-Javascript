### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is an object representation of every element on a web page and can be modified with scripting languages. It allows programming languages to connect to the objects on a web page.
2. What is an event?
Events are things that happen to the elements on a page, such as clicks, hovers, scrolling, and page loads.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a method that waits for a specific event to happen to a specific element, and then executes a block of code in response to that event.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
A NodeList lets us use forEach() but converting to an array would allow us to use all array methods on the objects in the NodeList and give us more flexibility.
5. What is a component? 
Components are stand-alone pieces of an application that handle one job. They can be reusable but they are separate from the main body of code.
