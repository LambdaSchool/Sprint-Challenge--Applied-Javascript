### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the html of any web page that has been converted into javascript. It is the live section of the page. Once the HTML has been read, the DOM then takes over. So the DOM can be added to in order to manipulate the HTML and create dynamic effects.
2. What is an event?
An event is user imput, like a mouse click or a key being pressed. It's something that the user does on the webpage.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is something that happens when an event happens. Like when this object is clicked (event) something will happen.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
So we can do things to the list. A nodelist doesn't help us out much, but an Array can be manipulated to create an effect. 
5. What is a component? 
A component is a way to set specifications for reusable objects, HTML elements, and effects in web pages. That way we can set the paramiters for a repeating object and its behavior, like buttons or atricles for example, and simply add the content of those repeating objects in the HTML file, and they'll all behave the same way.
