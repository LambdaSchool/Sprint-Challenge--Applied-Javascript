### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The document object model is a tool that developers use to allow them to manipulate elements of their webpage using Javascript.

2. What is an event?
An event is the action that occurs on the page when a user attempts to manipulate the page. For example, events determine what happens when using the mouse or keyboard for input.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener can be attached to certain elements on a page, or the entire page itself. They wait for a user to perform an action and trigger the event that determines how to handle that action/input.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Converting a nodelist to an array gives you access to all of the built in array methods that Javascript offers. 

5. What is a component? 
A component is a collection of all of the resources that your page requires (including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and combining them into a reusable format. The code can be written once and recycled for use in similar projects.
