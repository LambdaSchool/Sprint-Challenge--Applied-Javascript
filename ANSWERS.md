### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? - The Document Object Model. 
2. What is an event? - An event is just that: an event; for example, an interaction a user has with a web page, like clicking on a tab. 
3. What is an event listener? - An event listener (eventListener) is a property that can be added to an element to "listen" for an event so that some action or attribute change can be triggered. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? - NodeLists share some of the properties and have some of the same methods available that arrays do, but not all, such as forEach and map.
5. What is a component? - A component is basically a reusable way to style lots of elements.
