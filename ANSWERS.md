### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component? 


Answers:

1. DOM connects webpages to scripts (like HTML and JS). DOM's structure is like a tree, where it's branch -> node -> objects. The script then can alter the webpage's properties/attributes/styles/ etc.

2. The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.

3. The EventListener interface represents an object that can handle an event dispatched by an EventTarget object.

4. NodeList, as the name reads, contains a list of nodes. This list has to be converted to an array before the programmer can manipulate/use the information in the NodeList.

5. Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling.
