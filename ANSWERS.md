## Answers

1. The DOM stands for the Document Object Model and essentially represents the entire HTML structure of a given web page or application.  Thus the DOM contains all of the relative nodes, child nodes, and sibling notes of a given webpage.  The DOM also represents the idea that this structure is considered one large accessible object that can be hooked into by the ability to access nodes or groups of nodes with a programmatic language.  It just so happens the most common language that serves this function on the web is JavaScript.  So, as of current definitions, the DOM allows programmers to use JavaScript to select and create interactions with elements of the DOM, and create both content and styles that are dynamic and fluid for the end user. In reality, the DOM also represents an API that establishes the ability for the window object and HTML document to function in this manner.
