### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is a representation of a document as rendered by a user agent, exposed to a scripting language through a standard API. DOM stands for "Document Object Model".

2. What is an event?
An event is a representation of a user action or change of state. Events are realized in the DOM as event objects which are send to the global Window object for handling.

3. What is an event listener?
An Event Listener is a function attached to a specific DOM node and registered as the handler for a specific kind of event. When events of that kind are registered on that node, or its decendant nodes, that function will be invoked to handle the event.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
A NodeList isn't as full-featured as an Array. Converting to an Array gives us access to all the methods and properties of an Array.

5. What is a component?
A component is a high level representation of DOM functionality and structure, realized through a modular integration of HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
