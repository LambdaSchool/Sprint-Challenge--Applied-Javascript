### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is a tree-like object model created by the browser based off HTML and CSS when it constructs a website. These are javascript objects that we can manipulate directly with our javascript.

2. What is an event?
An event is any number of changes that can occur on a website, and can come from user interaction, such as clicking, typing, or moving the mouse. Or it can be an event of the browser itself, such as a page load or cache event. It can also be the finishing of a timer that was set in the javascript.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is set up in the browser to watch for certain events. An event listener has an event handler, which is a function that is invoked once the event occurs.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
This gives us access to array methods for manipulating the array.

5. What is a component? 
A component is a reusable structure or object we can use to create parts of the DOM iteratively, or to create similar structures in multiple projects.
