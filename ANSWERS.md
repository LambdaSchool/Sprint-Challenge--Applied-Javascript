### Answers:
1. Document Object Model, is what happens when your code is rendered. You can code everything but it doesn't do anything until it's rendered. The DOM is the living version of your code. It's an api that lets you interact with your code.

2. Any event is any number of predefined conditions (can be mouse based, script based, etc.) that when used with a listener can cause certain actions to occur when that condition is met.

3. An event listener is a method, accessed through the DOM api, that allows you to attach "listeners" to certain pieces of HTML code, that when the event listed in the param is met, with cause your code to run.

4. Although NodeList is useful, it's far more limited in terms of it's methods. Converting it into an Array gives you access to all of those more powerful methods.

5. Components are pieces of resulable code that allow us to save time by being able to alter or modify our website, in ways that are scalable and make it easy to update.
