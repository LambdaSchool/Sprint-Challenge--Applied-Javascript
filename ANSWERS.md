### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    the DOM is the document object model. The DOM is a branching 'tree' model made up of nodes that is created after a browser renders your HTML.
2. What is an event?
    An event is something that occurs when a user interacts with a webpage, and Javascript affects the HTML as a response to this interaction.
3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is the part of the Javascript that 'handles' the event; it says what to do when an event, like a click, occurs.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    A NodeList is a shallow copy of an array and does not have access to array methods. By converting a NodeList to an array, you have access to array methods like .map .
5. What is a component? 
    A component is a reusable piece of code that allows for shared functionality between similar classes.
