### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
* The Document Object Model is an API that the browser creates to interpret and modify the web page.

2. What is an event?
* An event is an action or occurrence that you can use to trigger a function.

3. What is an event listener?
* An event listener is what we add to the element we want to track for events. It is also where we refrence the function we want to run when that event is triggered.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
* We convert a node list into an array because, while a node list is array-like, it does not contain all the array properties. We need to map that array so it can collect all the elements we are refrencing, with a class, in order to re create the elements and add custom functionality. 

5. What is a component? 
A component is an object that can take any number of html elements with a given class and add functionality and features to each element passed in.
