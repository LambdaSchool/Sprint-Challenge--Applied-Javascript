### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    The DOM is the Document Object Model which is an object version of the html on a webpage. It allows you to alter and manipulate data on HTML pages such as content and styling. It allows for user interactivity as well.

2. What is an event?
    An event is what allows for an action to take place on a website which will then update the content in some way. An example is a button click. 

3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is what watches for an event to take place. It checks to see if the event is happening so that it can trigger the methods to update the content. 

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    Arrays allows us more functionality than NodeLists with Array methods. 

5. What is a component? 
    It is comparable to a constructor function in the way that it is code that will be reused many times. When creating an element on the page through the DOM you can give all similar elements the same basic functionality and events.
