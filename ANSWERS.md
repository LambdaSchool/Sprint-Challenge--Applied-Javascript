### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM stands for Document Object Model, which represents a tree structure of the different elements- nodes- that make up a web page. The DOM can be interacted with and modified via an API. 
 
2. What is an event?
An event is a "reaction", created in Javascript, to something happening with the HTML in the page. Events can be tied to specific elements on a page and are triggered by an event listener.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is what picks up on the specified behaviors to trigger said event. If there is an event listener for a mouse click, the event listner will wait for that mouse click and then fire off the event.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Node lists are array-like but lack a lot of the common array methods, such as using `.map()` or `filter()`. 

5. What is a component? 
A component is a stang-alone, reusable part of our program which can be instantiated whenever we have a need for one. An example of a component would be dropdown menu on a navigation menu.
