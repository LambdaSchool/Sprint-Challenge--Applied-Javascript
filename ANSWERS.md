### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that converts/parses the programmers HTML into nodes and objects. The virtual representation of the DOM looks the same as the HTML although it can correct some coder errors. 
2. What is an event?
An event is any interaction that a user has with a webpage. When a user scrolls a mouse over the page or clicks on the page, it can be tracked.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is added to track a specific type of event. A simple page may only "listen" for a click one tab. More sophisticated pages may change images or content depending on where the user's mouse is scrolling. Marketers may want to track all mouse scrolls to see what users are most attracted to on a page or how far down a user has scrolled on a page.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? 
NodeLists have limited functionality. By converting it to an array, all array methods (map, reduce, splice, etc.) could be applied to the newly created array.
5. What is a component? 
A component is one section of a webpage, e.g., the nav bar, header, carousel, etc. By splitting sections into different components teams are able to divide the different sections up so multiple programmers can work on the same page at the same time.
