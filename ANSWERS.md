### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

    "Document Object Model" -- the tree of nodes, originating from the HTML and JavaScript code, that is ready to be rendered in the browser.

2. What is an event?

    One of a long list of things that can happen, especially user inputs, that an event listener can be told to watch for.

3. What is an event listener?

    Some code that waits to react to a certain event, triggering other code which then excecutes.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

    So we can use array methods like .map() on it.

5. What is a component? 

    A modular, self-contained combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaSript that can be used to replicate a bunch of DOM elements that have similar behavior.
