### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? 
The DOM is essentially a Javascript representation of our HTML document in which we can in real time manipulate and change items. It is an object representation of the document page/s.
2. What is an event?
An event is any interaction that a site user has with the site, i.e. click or hover. The event's corresponding Javascript tells the page how to act when the event is triggered.
3. What is an event listener?
The event listener is a piece of code that looks for a specific interaction('event'), on a specified element and tells the page how to act when that event has taken place. It takes in two arguments- the event being listened for and the function to call when the event takes place.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
It allows us to use native array methods such as map and filter, as opposed to only being able to use forEach.
5. What is a component? A component as a piece of code that once created allows us to call it in multiple places when the code shares the same attributes. In essence it is a reusable chunk of code that helps us save space and time.
