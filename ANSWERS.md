### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model. The HTML you write is parsed by the browser and turned into the DOM.  It is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

2. What is an event?
Events are a part of the Document Object Model and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code. JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript functions or code, which cause buttons to close windows, animations to run, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.

3. What is an event listener?
In the context we are applying it, an eventlistener is a Javascript DOM method that will trigger a function or some other action when an event has occured. They basic syntax is something like this: .addEventListener("EVENT_TYPE", ANONYMOUS OR CB FUNCTION);

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
To have greater access to manipulation of the list using array methods. 

5. What is a component? 
A component is a set of reusable custom elements whose functionality is encapsulated away from the rest of your code allowing you to utilize them as many times as you wish in your web apps.
