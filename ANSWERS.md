### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? 
DOM is a model used to allow the browser's engine to convert HTML documents into nodes with object properties and methods, and access/manipulate those nodes with Javascript.  
2. What is an event? 
An event is an action that has any kind of influence on the original document. These actions can be obvious, like clicks, or more subtle like the loading of a document or resizing of a window. 
3. What is an event listener? 
An event listener is a function tied to a given object or element that executes when an event is processed. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Because array objects have more properties and methods available to them.
5. What is a component? 
A component is a function that takes the DOM representation of an object as its parameter, and within itself provides an environment suitable to host a suite of customized methods and properties that can be used to modify the object in useful ways, including connecting the state of that object to other components.
