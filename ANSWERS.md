### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
-- The Docuement Object Model conceptually defines the logical structure of a document and how it is accessed and manipulated.
The DOM functionally is an API that facilitates the ability to execute what it conceptually defines.
2. What is an event?
-- An event is an action or actitity that a person or machine creates while interacting with a program. This could be a click, scroll, download, copy/paste....anything that illustrates that the program is being interacted with.
3. What is an event listener?
-- An event listener is code that is programmed to execute when a particular event or activity occurs. It is basically a loop that waits for a predefined event and then executes.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
---A NodeList is 'array like.' This means that while it shares some aspects of an array it is not technically an array. Because it is not technically an array we do not have access array methods. Array methods allow us to manipulate data in a muc more nuanced way. Thus we want to convert a NodeList to an array.
5. What is a component? 
-- A component is a modular section of code that, achieves a particular task. If desinged well, we should be able to port this component to other projects that need that same task executed.
