### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    The DOM, or document object model, is an interface that allows you to manipulate elements in your document (which is treated as a 'tree' where each element in the document/tree is a  node)across languages (you can manipulate HTML elements on the DOM using JavaScript, for example)
2. What is an event?
    An event is an action that occurs when your elements of your document are interacted with in some way (clicking on elements, selecting text, dragging and dropping, etc.). 
3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is a property which can be added to an element using the method .addEventListener(); event listeners will execute an action or manipulate the element on the occurrence of a specified event (for example, an event listener that will toggle a class on and off of an element when that element is clicked).
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    Convert a NodeList into an Array using the method Array.from(nodeList);
5. What is a component? 
    A component is a reusable piece of code that uses JavaScript class syntax to create a more efficient way of building multiple elements which share similar styling and functionality, without having to write the same lines of code over and over again.
