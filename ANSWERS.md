### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM stands for Object Document Model. It is an object model representation of our HTML code that is a tree-like structure which we can modify it's displayed appearance based on user interactions. 

2. What is an event?
An event is a representation of something happening on our website based on things the user does or how the page loads. Things like button clicks, scrolling, keypresses or window manipulation can all be events on which we can execute commands with event listeners. 

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a piece of code that gets executed when an event takes place. This could be for example a click event listener which executes a function to open a form on a page when a user wants to login to a website. 

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
A Nodelist is an array-like structure which has access to forEach but not the robust array methods of a regular array such as .map, .reduce or .filter. 

5. What is a component? 
A component is a collection of HTML, CSS and Javascript code which can be reused and gives a website functionality. Examples we have seen are headers with nav links, or articles on a website that all take data and are intended to behave the same way. Components allow us to classify them all as one thing and run methods on any or all components we want using our query selectors that we learned about.
