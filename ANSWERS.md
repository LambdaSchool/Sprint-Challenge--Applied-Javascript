### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the document that is the webpage and is the link between the HTML and CSS, so we can access and change these documents. 

2. What is an event?
    An event is something that happens like a mouse click or a key press or a form submition, anything that the user does when they are visiting the webpage.

3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is a function that "listens" or waits for an event to happen on the webpage, such as a mouse click or key press.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    A NodeList doesn't have as many methods attached to them like Arrays do.

5. What is a component?
