### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is an organized set of data that builds a web page. Using the elements of the DOM, we can change a page's structure, content, and style.
2. What is an event?
 An event is any "action" that a user has with a website; scrolling, typing into a form, clicking a button, etc.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a code method you can put onto an element to make something happen when the user interacts with a site. Event listeners "listen" for events (like a click) and then callback what we write into the code.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
NodeLists will not work with array prototype methods (like push or pop, for example), so you must convert them into an array first.
5. What is a component? 
A component is a set of code that can be reused to build multiple elements that will behave in a similar way.`1
