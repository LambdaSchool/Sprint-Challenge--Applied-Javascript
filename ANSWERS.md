### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model. It represents the page as nodes and objects, which allows languages like Javascript
to interact with the page through those nodes and objects.

2. What is an event?
An event is something (a click, a scroll, a print command) that has taken place on the page.  Events can be 
used as triggers for Javascript functionality.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a coded connection between an event and an element that should be triggered somehow by that event. 

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Nodelists do not have access to all of the wonderful and useful array methods.

5. What is a component? 
A component is a custom, reusable, and self-contained (ie, standalone) element.
