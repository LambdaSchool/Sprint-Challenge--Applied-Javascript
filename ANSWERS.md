### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
It's the interface that allows a programming language to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a website. The browser uses HTML and CSS to structure and style a website and creates a representation of the HTML document called the **Document Object Model** (DOM). The **model** allows JavaScript to access text and elements of a website **document** as **objects**.

2. What is an event?
**Events** are actions that take place in a browser that are either initiated by the user or the browser. Using JavaScript responses to events, the browser can respond to interactions in a variety of ways.

3. What is an event listener?
An **event listener** is an interface to an element that waits and *listens* for the specified event to occur.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
NodeList's are very useful but are only *array-like*, not actual arrays. As such, many Array methods such as `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` are not accesible. 

5. What is a component? 
Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling. In practice, this translates to having an easy, reusable way to create tabs, buttons, or any other element of an HTML document that needs to be created multiple times.
