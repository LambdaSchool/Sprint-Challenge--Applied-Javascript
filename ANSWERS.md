### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The document object model is a model for how a page should look and act using JavaScript. The HTML file is like the blueprint, and the DOM, which is a JavaScript object, has all the elements on the page.


2. What is an event?
Events are the different ways that a user can interact with a site. Whether it is a click, scroll, moving of the mouse, etc, they are all events that the browser detects.


3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is when an event happens on an element and you run a callback. So if a certain event is called on an element and you run a callback in return of that event, that's an event listener.


4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
The main reason we would want to convert a nodelist into an array is because there are so many more methods that we can use when the list is an array. Nodelists and arrays are very similar in that they both contain a collection of data. With a nodelist, you only have access to about 5 methods, while you have access to about 4-5 times more methods.


5. What is a component? 
A component is when you combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allow it to be reusable. They make it very easy to manipulate the page. For example, if you give a tab a certain event when clicked using a component, you can simply go to the HTML and add another tab, and it will automatically have those same attributes.
