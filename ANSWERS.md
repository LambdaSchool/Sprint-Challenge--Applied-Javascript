### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
  1. Document Object Model. It is a way to represent HTML elements inside a Javascript file so that the html file and js file can interact.

2. What is an event?
  1. An event can be anything that triggers something to happen. It can be anything from the initial page load to user input like a click or keypress.

3. What is an event listener?
  1. An event listener is like the trigger that executes a function when a specified event occurs.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
  1. While a NodeList is array-like, it does not have as many associated methods and is harder to work with so we convert to an Array to gain access to all the array methods so we can do more with the elements inside.
5. What is a component?
  1. A component is basically a class. It's reuseable so we can make multiple copies of objects with similar attributes without having to create a new object for each instance.
