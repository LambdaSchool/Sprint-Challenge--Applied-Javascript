### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
 "Document Object Model" Is a structure representing a tree, which is a common
 structure throughout programming. Each "node" represents an object of the
 document where you can fully manipulate, mutate and override within JavaScript

2. What is an event?
 An event is a method on an object that is triggered when "something"
 happense, most often these are mouse clicks but simply put it wait's for user
 interaction before excecuting some sort of function.

3. What is an event listener?
 Very similar to an event, the "listener" is what actually waits for said user input.
 Usually a click, or some sort of page scroll, these allow for very interactive
 interfaces.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
 Converting something to an array allows for MUCH easier manipulation within JS.
 Having "items" or "objects" in an array format makes the programmers job much more
 simple rather than having to fumble around with individual nodes.

5. What is a component? 
 A component is a either 1 or more JavaScript files that are capable of
 automatic adjustment to new content and input. As we have been shown this is
 unbeleievely useful for "tabbing" or making any kind of "dropdown" menu. Setting up
 a component saves a lot of time and headache in the future.
