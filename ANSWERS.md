### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?  The DOM is the document object model that is made up of a tree-like structure of nodes. It uses the HTML on the webpage and it is able to be changed by using Javascript.
2. What is an event? An event takes place in the DOM. It can be user-generated or API generated and the event is used to notify code of things taking place. Some events use other interfaces depending on the event that is taking place.
3. What is an event listener? An event listener is added to elements that we want to be interactive with the user. It can use many different ways like click and double click, which will change the page based on the Javascript that is used to change its style or function.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? We would want to convert a Nodelist to an Array so we can use methods that Arrays can use that Nodelist can not.
