### Questions:
**1. What is the DOM?**
> The Document Object Model is both an interface for manipulating static source-code (such as HTML) using a scripting
 language (such as JavaScript) as well as a dynamic representation of that manipulated source-code (visualized 
 externally as a rendered web page and internally as a tree-like structure of nodes representing HTML elements). 

**2. What is an event?**
> An event is simply an action or occurrence taking place inside the system in which programming occurs.

**3. What is an event listener?**
> An event listener is a DOM interface for recognizing events within a program and assigning methods whereby the 
programs reactions to the events can be programmed and/or manipulated._  

**4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?**
> A NodeList should be converted into a proper Array because a NodeList is simply an array-like object and not a true 
array, meaning it does not posses the inherit properties and methods of JavaScript arrays, severely limiting it's 
usefulness; by converting a NodeLIst into an Array the data contained in the NodeList can be much more easily 
referenced and manipulated.

**5. What is a component?** 
> A web component is an interface that allows for the creation of custom and reusable HTML elements that can then be 
assigned and called as though they were any other standard HTML element.
