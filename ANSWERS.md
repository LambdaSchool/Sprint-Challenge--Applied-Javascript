### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
   The DOM is an language-neutral interface for multiple languages to be able to interact with a live web page. It is a representation of the structure of the HTML document, and gives Javascript access to the HTML. 
2. What is an event?
   An event is something that happens to an HTML element, which our Javascript handles to react in a predetermined way. The events are input from the user, such as mouse clicks, mouse gestures, keyboard presses, etc. 
3. What is an event listener?
   An event listener is a piece of code that tells an HTML element to wait for a certain event, such as a mouse click. When the element detects the event has occured, it then runs a function called an event handler.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
   NodeLists have access to only a small number of methods. If we want to use something more interesting than forEach, we have to convert the NodeList into an array first.
5. What is a component? 
   A component is a self-contained object that can be reused multiple times, and comes with its own prebuilt styling and methods. For example, a button template that can be used multiple times over many different projects.
