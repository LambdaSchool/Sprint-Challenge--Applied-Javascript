### Questions:

1. What is the DOM?

   - The Document Object Model represents our HTML in the form of nodes, it is not HTML itself. It is an API structured like a tree, a hierarchy of elements that can be grabbed and modified. The DOM is used to make an app/page more interactive using a programming language (usually JavaScript).

2. What is an event?

   - It's when a user interacts with our web page/ app (click, scroll, presses a key, etc)

3. What is an event listener?

   - It is a function that we attach to an element so that when a user interacts with that element, some kind of reaction is triggered.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

   - To gain access to array methods

5. What is a component?
   - Used in modern development, a component is a part of an app built with a custom, reusable combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
