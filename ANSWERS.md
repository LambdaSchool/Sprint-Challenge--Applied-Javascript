### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?  Document Object Model
2. What is an event? Something taking place in the DOM (user generated: click, mouse move, or API generated)
3. What is an event listener? An object that can handle an event dispatched by an eventTarget
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? There are many more things that can be done with arrays than with nodeLists (methods, properties, etc...)
5. What is a component? A component is a reusable piece of code to build custom elements, whos functionality is not tied to the rest of the code.
