### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component? 
1. The DOM (document object model) is a programming interface.  It represents a web page so that the structure, style, and content of the page can be dynamically altered by a program such as JavaScript.
2. An event can be almost any kind of user action/interaction on a web page, e.g. mouse clicks, mouse movement, keystrokes, opening a dialog box to print, going offline, coming online, etc.  There are hundreds of them.
3. An event listener is code assigned to a given element(s) that triggers a response when a given event is detected.
4. Arrays have many more properties and are much easier to iterate over.  NodeLists have indices and that's about it.
5. A component is a small section of code that can be used over and over, such as a constructor.
