### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

    The DOM is the javascript object representation of the html elements.

2. What is an event?

    An event is a user supplied occurence that happens on the webpage. ie. a click, or mouse movements.

3. What is an event listener?

    An event listener is a function with 2 arguments. The first argument listens to the page meaning it is constantly checking for the provided event. The second argument performs a supplied function if the event takes place.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

    We would convert a nodelist in to an array because natively a nodelist is like an array but isnt one and only has the array function forEach. If we convert it to an array using Array.from() we can use all the functions that a standard array affords us.

5. What is a component? 

    Components are like blueprints that give selected elements the same style and functionality.
