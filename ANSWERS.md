### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the document object model which treats an HTML document as part of a tree structure where each node is an object representing part of the document.
2. What is an event?
Events are things that happen to HTML elements in the browser.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a function that waits for an event to occur.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
We convert a NodeList into an Array so that we may iterate over the items in the NodeList.  The NodeList itself is only array-like so can't be iterated through until converted into the Array.
5. What is a component? 
A component is a small and potentially reusable set of logic, behavior and interface elements.
