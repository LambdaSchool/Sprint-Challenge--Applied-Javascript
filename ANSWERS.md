### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

    `DOM stands for Document object model. In my words DOM is a tree model that goes from window -> document -> element each with its set of methods functions and properties. It makes the entire HTML document programmable; which is converted to JS DOM model on runtime. DOM is a client side (front end component)?`

2. What is an event?

    `An event is when something happens, generally a verb, denotes the doing, click, dblclick, mouseover etc. These events are pre-defined by ECMAScript Standards. You can also create custom events and then call them only when you are on the ECMA board and have the power to pass it! :-)`

3. What is an event listener?

    `An event listener is a method that ideally waits for an event specified to happen (listens to the event) on a specific element/document or window. You can add an event to any item and use a callback function to perform an action.`

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

    `I know this but I cannot recall well, My guess is you cannot perform array methods on the NodeList except a foreach and this could be cumbersome at times since you may want to use map(), reduce() and other advanced operations and a foreach returns nothing, just performs the function and kicks out.`

    `Now I shall refer to the documentation to verify!`

5. What is a component? 

    `I know what that is in English, but I need to look it up.`

    `Ah ok! So it's resuable objects, with associated styling - such as a date picker, a tab component, carousel, which can be resused in multiple projects. I wish this said tell me the first SOLID principle! :-)`
