### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The document. The web. The page we're creating/working on. It's how we manage and add functionality to our website. Javascript being the main language used to manipulate the DOM. 
2. What is an event?
So many things. A click, a page loading. Some sort of action that occurs in the DOM.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener listens for actions in the dom, if we tell it to which allows us to apply Javascript to have certain reactions react to the action or event. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Because an array gives us a while bunch of methods we can use that aren't available on just a node list. Also, I think NodleLists are temporary. Arrays are forever. 
5. What is a component? 
 Things that help keep our code dry. They're like packages of commonly used code that we can reuse, rather than having to redo certain things.
