### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is the Document Object Model, a javascript representation of our HTML. It lives in the browser. The browser reads our HTML, turns it into JS and then displays that JS as the DOM.

2. What is an event?

An event is something the browser listens for and notifies the browser of its occurence, to action something after a specific event occurs - for example, the mouse encountering an element, or a click.

3. What is an event listener?

It is a function that puts a callback function into action when a specific event occurs that it listens for before going into action.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

A NodeList is solely an Array-like object, so in order to use actual Array methods such as Map, we need to convert the NodeList into a true Array.

5. What is a component? 

A component is a piece of code that can be used to create classes and elements for elements that share similar functions and styling in JS.
