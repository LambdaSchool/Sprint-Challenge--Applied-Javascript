### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
       
        A programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The DOM is represented as nodes and objects, allowing modification by scripting languages such as JavaScript.
2. What is an event?
    
        An event get creates a constructor function for a new Event object when addEventListener is called. The event comes with information and props and methods about the element it was called on. Also, the every new instance of an event comes with it's own properties and methods to do various things like "stopPropagation".
    
3. What is an event listener?

        It is a method on the DOM that allows you to attach events to elements and other things via the use of a "type" of event and a callack function.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
        
        We would do this so that we can gain access to Array methods thus giving us greater power in traversing the NodeList.
5. What is a component? 
    
        The product of mixing functional and object oriented programming to create a very modulated code, and by modulated I mean that only deals with one thing. It is a way of organizing your code into parts.
