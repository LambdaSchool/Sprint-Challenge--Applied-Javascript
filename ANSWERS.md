### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
### The dom is the programming interface for HTML and XML documents, and it stands for the document object mooel. Its purpose is to represent the page, so that the page can be manipulated or changed. The DOM is an object oriented version of the web-page, and it can be modified by using a language such as JavaScript.
2. What is an event?
### An event is an item that is used typically with combination of functions such as JavaScript functions, and the function is exectued once the event happens within the web-page, such as a user might click, or scroll using their mouse are two examples of possible events.
3. What is an event listener?
### An event listener is a method that enables a programmer to attach an event handler (such as a click or scroll), to a element which is specified.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
### Although NodeLists are array like, they don't come with all the functionality that arrays in JavaScript come with such as the ability to use methods such as Reduce, MAP, or other methods. NodeList does have a prototype that is NodeList.prototype.forEach, however Array's have more functionality that NodeList's do not have.
5. What is a component? 
###Components are pieces of code that are re-usable that can be used to build elemenets in our web applications, or web-pages, when elements share similar functionality and styling. Using components allows us to keep our code DRY.
