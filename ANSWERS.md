### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
> The dom stands for DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL. It is what actually renders our code on the browser. The engine of the browser takes our code and the DOM api is what outputs it into the page.
2. What is an event?
> An event is any external action that takes place on the DOM. It could mean that someone clicks a button, or scrolls, or types.
3. What is an event listener?
> an event listener is a function you can add to your code. It 'listens' or 'watches' for any changes to the dom or any events and then will execute a function when its desired event occurs.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
> A NodeList is part of the DOM API and therefore we don't have the typical methods and properties inherited with it. We have much more usability out of a NodeList if it becomes an Array prototype. At that point, we can use any array methods with the converted NodeList object
5. What is a component?
> A component is a modular piece of code that does a specific thing. It's composed of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. An example of a component might be a clickable 'hamburger' menu, or a carousel. The idea of components is that they provide readibility and functionality to your code while also allowing the component the freedom to be used elsewhere in the application.
