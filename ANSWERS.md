### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    A: The Document Object Model is an API on which we are able to manipulate the document object, or what is contained in the document that we are viewing in our window.

2. What is an event?
    A: An event is a trigger that occurs upon the detection of certain conditions. Those conditions are different actions that can be attached to objects. Upon happening, they can change the properties of the object listening to the event (this can be achieved by running a callback function, too).

3. What is an event listener?
    A: An event listener is a method that invokes a callback when an event is triggered to its designated target.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    A: NodeLists by themselves are array-like, but they are not arrays. Therefore, they do not have access to array methods, and a lot of those methods are impressively useful to getting certain outputs done in a faster way. So, we convert NodeLists into Arrays for the ability to use array methods (it's efficient and familiar!).

5. What is a component?
    A:  A component is a combination of content, styling, and functionality that creates a usable, interactable element for use on a web page. 
        In our case, we use HTML for the content, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the functionality.
