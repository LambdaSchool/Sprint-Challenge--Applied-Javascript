### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
-DOM stands for Document Object Model and it allows use to use JavaScript to manipulate/interact with the HTML and CSS and other attributes of a page we are on.

2. What is an event?
-An event is something that activates/executes our JavaScript code (like clicking on a button, the click is the event that triggers the button's function that we wrote in JS). 

3. What is an event listener?
-An event listener is the code/function that knows to look for a specific event (like a click or scroll wheel) and then executes a function that we have layed out within the event listener function. Essentially it's how we know an event has happened so our code can "wake up"

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
-We would do this so that we have access to all the tools (methods, functions, etc) that array's have, and allow us to use it on the data from the NodeList. Such tools like .map .filter .reduce etc can be very useful/powerful but only if we convert the NodeList into an array do we have access to them.

5. What is a component? 
- a component is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS code that allows use to quickly and easily create/effect new content with similar functionality and be able to go back and easily edit that functionality in a very DRY way.
