### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component? 

### Answers:
1. The DOM is the document object model, which is a live object that we've been altering with javascript. (Fancy events incoming!)
2. An event is something that occurs on a webpage; i.e. a user clicking, or a user submitting a form.
3. An event listener is something that you can apply to objects (via the `addEventListener` method) so that we can trace these events and make things happen and/or change on the webpage in response to them.
4. We'd convert a nodelist into an array so that we'd be able to use array methods (like `map`).
5. A component is essentially a DOM class for repeatable items on the webpage. Typically it'll be certain items, such as a navbar or a menu of some sort.
