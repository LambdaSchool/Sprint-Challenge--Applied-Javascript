4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

The benefit of converting a NodeList to an Array is that you have access to more methods.

5. What is a component? 

Components are pieces of code that can be brought together for reuse. For example, you could create a nav bar with whatever features you like, and you could reuse that code on another project if you needed the same type of nav bar.
