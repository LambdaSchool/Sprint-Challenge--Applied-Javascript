### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface to HTML that abstracts it as a tree of javascript objects.  This is very powerful and cool.

2. What is an event?
An event is an input from the user that we can listen for and attach logic to.  

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is placed on a DOM object and executes its callback function whenever the event it's listening for occurs on that object or bubbles through it.  

4. What is jQuery?
Jquery is a library that extended javascript to be able to interact with the DOM.  Now javascript has built in methods to accomplish the same thing, but jQuery is still used.  It has a nicer syntax but is heavy.

5. What is a component?
A component is a javascript class or set of classes that bundle together interface objects and logic to make... well, anything you might want, really. A good example is the tab navigator from yesterday's project.
