# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
Upon page load, the browser creates the Document Object Model, which is a object-oriented representation of the webpage that javascript and
other programming languages may interact with. It is organized like a family tree, with everything stemming down from document, and data
and elements represented as "nodes".
2. What is an event?
An event is any one of the assortment of actions that javascript watches for in the DOM. These are either triggered by the user interacting
with the page, or generated by the DOM or other API.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a function given to javascript code that is invoked whenever an event is triggered on a page.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
NodeLists are a special kind of list which are appropriate for the DOM, so we cannot use all the same Array.prototype methods on them.
Fortunately, if we convert them with Array.from, we will be able to use any of these methods on the result. These methods will also affect
the original nodelist if they make changes in data, because the array and nodelist share the same memory.
5. What is a component? 
A component is any part of a webpage that is user-interactive, and that uses html, css, and javascript together to achieve this.
