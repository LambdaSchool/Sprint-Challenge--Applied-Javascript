### Questions:
1. What is the DOM? -- The DOM is the document object model that treats elements in HTML as objects that have properties, methods, children, and parents.

2. What is an event? -- An event is any action that takes place in the context of the website, such as clicking on a button or resizing the page.

3. What is an event listener? -- An event listener is always waiting for a specific event to happen, like a mouse click, and executes a piece of code in response to the event.

4. What is jQuery? -- jQuery is a library that makes it easier to work with the DOM because it uses shorthand for common and more complicated pieces of regular code.

5. What is a component? -- A component is like a class in that it encapsulates a set of features and actions that can be applied to multiple objects in our HTML. It helps us to keep our code clean since we don't have to repeat it for every identical object.
