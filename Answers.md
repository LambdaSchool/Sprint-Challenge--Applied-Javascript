### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
    the DOM is short for document object model.  It basically turns the HTML into nodes and objects and by doing that, JS can be used to manipulate the different nodes and objects to create an interactive webpage.

2. What is an event?
    An event is simply something that the computer or you does to the HTML.

3. What is an event listener?
    an event listener is a method that is added to an object in the DOM.  It is basically a function that executes when a certain event is "heard."

4. What is jQuery?
    jQuery is an older (in terms of tech) library.  The most important use is that it allows for coding with the DOM across different browsers.  This was a big issue due to the browser wars.  jQuery also introduced a lot of other good features and is the basis for many things we have today such as map and bootstrap.

5. What is a component? 
    A component is a function you can reuse to build multiple similar-elements in your webpage.
