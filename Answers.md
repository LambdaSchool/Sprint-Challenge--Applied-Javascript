1. What is the DOM?
    The DOM is the Document Object Model, and is a reference point for languages to integrate with the HTML of a webpage. It is found in Javascript as a collective of nodes on the Window.
2. What is an event?
    An event is any input from the client side computer, such as a mouse click, a keypress, or even the hovering of an element. There are many system events.
3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener, is a property set to an object, that handles the input of an event, and fires a callback function as a response.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    One practical reason, would be to get the full set of array methods available, as a NodeList itself is only an array like object and only has access to .length and .forEach if I'm not mistaken.
5. What is a component? 
    A component is modular code that can be used to implement features and styles across a specific set of instances in the DOM as defined by the choices of what you wish to do with the DOM. It simplifies actions taken by JavaScript, and allows them to apply over many different elements that match the conditions outlined by the component.
