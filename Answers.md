# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
  - The DOM is the Document Object Model and it is a big object that holds all of the nodes on a page an nodes are things like elements and the text inside the elements.
2. What is an event?
  - An event is something that the user does for example a click or a scroll could be an event. There are a lot of events each create an object that have a lot of different properties depending on what kind of event it was.
3. What is an event listener?
  - An event listener is something attached to a dom element that waits for or "Listens" for an event to happen and when said event does happen the event listener will use a callback to do something.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
  - A nodelist by default only comes with so many methods attached to it not the full list of methods that a javascript array has so for example if you wanted to use .map you couldn't do it on a nodelist because that method doesnt exist in the nodelist object so you would have to convert it to an array first and then you could use any array method including .map.
5. What is a component?
  - A component is basically reusable HTML CSS and JavaScript. It allows us to write the structure styles and JavaScript functionality for something like a tab navigator and then just copy and paste the html anywhere we need a tab navigator for example or if you needed it in another project you just link the JavaScript and css file and you can put the html for it anywhere in the new project and it will work just like on the other project. Components are very good at keeping our code DRY.
