# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
    Document Object Model.  It is the tree-like structure of our HTML file and it is LIVE.
2. What is an event?
    An event is an object that represents an action or state that may take place while using a webpage.
3. What is an event listener?
    An even listener watches for a specific event within a given DOM node or browser window. Once the event triggers the listener, the listener runs a function as defined by the programmer.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    Because arrays have many more default methods defined for them.  It can make them easier to work with.  In our examples we did this for use of the .map method.
5. What is a component? 
    Components are isolated sections of code designed for easy reuse within or across websites.  Components allow for easy use of adding extra elements and content to your HTML file, without needing you to edit your JS and CSS to achieve the desired functionality for the added elements.
