# Answers

1. The DOM stands for Document Object Model. This is the method by which programming languages can connect to HTML in order to make web pages interactive.
2. Events are a variety of common occurrences on a webpage, such as clicking the mouse, pressing a keyboard key, hovering over an image, or a network error occurring.
3. An event listener is a block of code that executes upon an event's occurrence.
4. A NodeList is an array-like object, but it lacks many useful methods that are native to an array. Converting a NodeList to an array grants the programmer access to those useful methods.
5. A component is a set of code made to be reused throughout a website.
