# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
    The DOM is an API used to pass information between JavaScript and HTML documents by treating HTML elements as JS objects.
2. What is an event?
    Actions taken by the browser user, such as mouse clicks, key presses, scrolling, window resizing, etc.
3. What is an event listener?
    Event listeners are a specification for how JavaScript should react if a given event is triggered.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    NodeLists are merely array-like objects and not native JavaScript and therefore they don't have access to all the JS methods arrays do. For instance, you can't just run a .sort() directly on a NodeList if you're trying to sort it.
5. What is a component? 
    A component is a block of code that creates a relatively common feature and is intended to be reusable between different webpages, like an accordian display or a dropdown menu.
