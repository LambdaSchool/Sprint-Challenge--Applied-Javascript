# Questions

1. What is the DOM?

Acronym for Document Object Module. We were taught that it is a tree-like model that represents the browser's rendering of our HTML & CSS. We can use a programming language, such as JavaScript to access and manipulate the DOM in real-time to create dynamic, as opposed to static, pages.

2. What is an event?

An event is any interaction with the user, such as a scroll, a mouse click, a hover, a touch for touchscreen, etc.

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener is a programming device that is used to react to those events and then do something. For example, if we have a button that the user can click, we set up an event listener that sits by idly until/if the user clicks the button. Then the listener executes a callback to a function that is designed to respond to the users click.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

If we needed to use array methods.

5. What is a component? 

A component is a block of code that can be reused for similar purposes. It allows for modular, DRY code.
