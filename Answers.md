1. What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface that allows multiple programming languages to interact with the HTML, CSS, and other aspects of a web page (called “nodes”). It allows us to provide live updates to a web site and is an object-oriented representation of the web page. Since it is language agnostic, it lacks a lot of the features and specificity that would be amazing to have if it was tied to JavaScript. However, this is necessary so that other languages can manipulate the nodes of text, elements, and other DOM nodes on a web page.
