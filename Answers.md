# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
THe document object model (DOM) is an interface that represents an HTML page so that programs can change and manipulate the style, structure and and content of a webpage without changing the underlying elements.
2. What is an event?
An event is anything that can happen in a browser. The more obvious events are things like 'mousedown' or 'click' or 'scroll', but events can extend out to a page loading, or to a video having buffered or other forms of backend interaction of a webpage and outside sources.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener serves the function of watching a certain item or the page entirely and noting when an expected event happens. The listener can then trigger a specific function to run when that event occurs.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
A nodelist has limited functionality, whereas an array has many built in methods and is much easier for us to manipulate. Especially when we consider applying a function to all of the elements in a nodelist. We can convert the nodelist into an array and apply powerful built-in methods like map().
5. What is a component?
Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements that share functionality and styling.
