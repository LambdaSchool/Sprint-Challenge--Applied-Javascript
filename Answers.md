4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Because sometimes we will need to do more things with our NodeList than its inherit methods will allow us. For example, if we need to get a modified new version of our NodeList, we might need to map it. NodeList only allows forEach, which would limit us to manipulate the array-like further.
