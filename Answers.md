1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is a document object model which is a live way that we can control the content on the page. It is an API used across multiple browsers
2. What is an event?
An event is the type of response you want the webpage to have to the specific event. There is a large list of events that can be summarized to MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent, and so on.
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener uses an event to output a callback function based on what the event is, for example if you had a click event listener that console logged "Clicked", it would log 'Clicked' every time you clicked it
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
We could convert a Nodelist using Array.from(Nodelist), this would be usefull if we wanted to use methods that are not available on node list such as .map and much much more.
5. What is a component? 
A component is a block of code that can be placed anywhere on the page and functions generally the same whatever you do. You could add more of the same component and it would extend to accomodate for those components. Components seem like the start of a dynamic webpage.
