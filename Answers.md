### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?

The DOM, which stands for Document Object Model, is an object that represents the HTML and CSS. When a developer tries to load HTML and CSS files into the browser, the browser parses or analyzes the HTML and CSS codes, and builds a structure that represents the HTML and its elements. These elements may look like HTML elements (e.g., <HTML> <body> <title>) but actually they are now the DOM elements (or the DOM nodes) and they are known as such. The DOM is also often called the DOM Tree because it looks like a tree with its branches and "leaves" or nodes. Inside each node is an object or objects which in turn "possesses" what objects possesses: keys, or properties, values, and methods.
