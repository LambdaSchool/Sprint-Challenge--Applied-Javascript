1. What is the DOM?

DOM is an acronym for "Document Object Model." The DOM is an object representation of the html elements that treats an HTML document as a tree-like structure where in each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree.

2. What is an event?

Every interaction a user has with a site is known as an event, so let event = ['click', 'moving the mouse', 'scrolling the page', 'pressing a key on the keyboard']; These are all events on the page and the browser can detect all of them.

3. What is an event listener?

It's exactly what it sounds like. When one of those events happens on an element that is selected to be listened on, we can detect it. This is called an event listener. We can put an event listener on an element, and give it a callback. When that event is triggered on the element, the callback is run.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

NodeList hsraes some similarities with an array but they are by no means the same. NodeList has access to .forEach; however, there is no .reduce or .map or any other array method that you can use, so this may be a reason to convert :)

5. What is a component?

A component works like a template. Components are essentially for components in web pages that are repeatable, if that makes sense? Being able to use HTML, CSS, and JS in a reusable/repeatable allos us to add buttons, dropdowns, menus, tabs and all sorts of interactive components..
