# Questions

1. What is the DOM?

A: The 'DOM' (Document Object Model), is a platform that is friendly to different programming languages. It allows a programmer to make dynamic updates/changes to the web page. The browser creates the 'DOM' when the page is loaded and it is constructed as a tree of objects.

2. What is an event?

A: An 'event' is part of the 'DOM' and is how a given HTML element triggers a JavaScript script.

3. What is an event listener?

A: The 'event listener' waits for an 'event' to trigger and then executes the script.


4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

A: Converting a 'NodeList' into an 'Array' allows us to use more methods which are available to
the arrays, but not the nodelist.


5. What is a component? 

A: I'm a little fuzzy on this one but the best way I can explain is that it is a block of code
that is meant to be re-used and created using classes or functions.
