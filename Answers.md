# Questions

**1. What is the DOM?**
The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API for HTML and XML documents designed to work for multiple programming languages. The DOM is made up of nodes and objects and can be traversed to change the structure, style, and layout and it can make cool things happen like the accordion example we had in class.

**2. What is an event?**
An event is something that happens on the DOM when something else is done. For example, I can set up a click event for a sound to play when something is clicked with the mouse, or I can set up something to happen when certain key presses are made on the keyboard.

**3. What is an event listener?**
An event listener is a function, mainly in JavaScript or Java, that listens for a given event that was programmed into the function. Once it hears the event, it'll do what it was told to do.

**4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?**
A NodeList is much more simple in terms of methods that it has available to it, so converting to an Array will allow us to be able to use the full list of methods that are available to an actual Array.

**5. What is a component?**
A component is a reusable piece of code that can be used over and over for specific functionality and it should be generic enough that others could use that same piece in their own projects.
