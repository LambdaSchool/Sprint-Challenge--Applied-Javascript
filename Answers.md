# Questions

1. What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model. It's essentially a tree of objects and their nodes that represent the many aspects of a webpage. Essentially the page is the DOCUMENT with OBJECTS on it. It's an object oriented view of a webpage.

2. What is an event?
An event would be something like a click. Something that "happens" to or on the webpage. That could be the page loading, the resizing of content on the page, or even a keypress.


3. What is an event listener?
A piece of JavaScript code that "listens" for an event to happen, and then if that event happens (to whatever object it's listening to) then it runs a function.


4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Because we can do more with it in that form! NodeLists are actually a browser API, whereas Arrays are JS. NodeLists also may be "live" (things like querySelector are static)


5. What is a component? 

A component is one of many pieces that make up a webpage that is pre-built and made in such a way that it can be "plugged-in" to other sections of the website or even a new one entirely.
