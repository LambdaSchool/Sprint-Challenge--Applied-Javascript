# Questions

1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is the Document Object Model. It’s an object representation of all of the different HTML elements on a webpage. It is “live”, and gives us an interface to interact and update the page in a number of ways.

2. What is an event?

An event is any interaction a user has with a site, whether that be moving the mouse, clicking, hovering over something, scrolling, pressing a key, etc.

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener is a method attached to an element that “listens” for a specific event to occur, then invokes a callback when that event occurs, which of course does some sort of action on the webpage.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

We would convert a NodeList to an Array to get the full spread of array methods to use. The NodeList is an “array like object”, and thus only has a handful of available methods to use. Once the NodeList is converted, we have all of the array methods available.

5. What is a component? 

Components are reusable pieces of code that we can use to build elements or sections of websites that use similar styling or functionality.
