1. What is the DOM?
A DOM is a programming interface we called an API which works like a translator that can translate from language to language.
It represent the web document as nodes and objects so we can manipulate it with lanuages like javascript because javascript does not understand HTML/CSS.

2. What is an event?
An event is anything that happens in the DOM including user generated events and events generated by other APIs.
For example, when users click on the mouse, it's a mouse event, a keyboard press is a keyboard event. 

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is a function that "listens" to any events happens on the page. When certain events is triggered, the event listener will run a command or a series of command.
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
We convert a NodeList into an Array because NodeLists are only array-like-objects. They do not possess the full methods that a real array has. If we want to use array methods that nodelists do not have, we need to first convert it into an array first.
5. What is a component? 
A component is a piece of reuseable code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling.
In its essence, components are a lot like modules where modules is more theoretical, and components are more physical.
For example, on a webpage, there can be multiple components: nav bar, tab changer ...etc.
