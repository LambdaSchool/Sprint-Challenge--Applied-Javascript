# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
    * DOM stands for the document object model, which is an application programming interface that structures the elements of a web page into a tree like object node structure and allows the access and manipulation of its objects via javascript.

2. What is an event?
    * An Event is an object on the DOM that has a large list of properties that represent different events that can happen on a web page. A DOM object can have an Event Listener set that will “listen” for events to happen and perform an action when it does. For instance a header element can be set to listen for a mouse click that will perform an animation when a user clicks on the header. 

3. What is an event listener?
    * An event listeners are methods that get applied to an event target or commonly an element on a web page, which “listen” for events such as user scrolls and mouse clicks, then perform an action via a callback after that event has been initiated. 

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    * Node lists are “array-like” and are limited in the methods that are available to them. Converting a node list into an array gives access to all of the methods on the Array object. 

5. What is a component? 
    * A component is a standalone combination HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be implemented or reused on any website or page.
