1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is simply the object representation of the html elements in whatever webpage we are working in. What is magical about it is that by accessing the DOM, we can then start to work and manipulate all those html and css elements, allowing us to change the styling, the structure, and even the content of the page itself, all without adding a single line of code to the CSS and HTML proper. The DOM is itself a tree structure made up of tree nodes, all containing the same property keys as each other node (the very proto of the whole thing is an object node)
2. What is an event?
An event is simply the way a user interacts with a given webpage. Any interaction from the user, such as a keyboard stroke, mouse click or hover, etc. is all captured by the DOM and then propagated as an event object. This special object can then store information about whatever the user specifically did and then send that information up and down the DOM's tree of nodes in either direction, up or down! Pretty cool!
3. What is an event listener?

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
