2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?

1. DOM stands for Document Object Model; a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

2. An event represents any event which takes place in the DOM.

3. An event handler specifies what event it is listening for using the event attribute. The handler contains script that is executed when an event flows to the object the handler is attached to.

4. We want to convert a NodeList into Array to give ourselves significantly more methods that we could use to maniupulate the data.

5. A component is a self-contained and reusable block of code.
