# Questions

1. What is the DOM?
    The DOM, which refers to the Document Object Model, is a way to interact with a browser live. It is an Object in the browser that contains every element in order. HTMl is parsed by the browser and turned into the DOM. Developers are able to manipulate DOM objects using JavaScript. 
2. What is an event?
    An event is an action that happens in the system you're programming, such as a click, a mouseover, or a hover.
3. What is an event listener?
    An event listener is code that runs in response to the event - it "listens" for the action to happen and then runs accordingly. Event listeners decide what kind of object is used. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    We would convert a NodeList into an Array if we wanted to use a method that the NodeList didn't have. An example would be a developer not wishing to use .forEach(), which always iterates over every single item every single time; one could then convert to an Array and use other methods such as .map(). 
5. What is a component? 
    A component is a standalone, independent part of an application used for one purpose. You can think of it as reusable code.
