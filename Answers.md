# Questions

1. What is the DOM? The Document Object Model-- an API that structures an HTML (or other compatible language) as a tree where each node is an object on the webpage.

2. What is an event? Any action or occurence that happens in the system being programmed.

3. What is an event listener? An event listener waits for a specific event to occur, and then runs the event handler (code that is run in response to the event firing).

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array? To use array methods! There are far more prototype methods available for Arrays than for NodeLists.

5. What is a component? Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling.
