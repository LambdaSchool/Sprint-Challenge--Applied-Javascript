### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
* Is a representation of the HTML file. Even though the HTML and the DOM seems to look similars there a big difference.
* The HTML is just a plain, flat file with characters in it, nothing else (like a piece of paper with something written in it). What is written in this file are no more than instructions tailored to be understood for a machine, the machine is the JS's engine.
* DOM, unlike the HTML, is an alive 'object' with properties, methods. Every Node element is linked with others that are its descendants and ascendants. The DOM is built based on the 'instructions' that the HTML carry in it.

2. What is an event?
* Events are the result of the interactions between our DOM and either an user or the system.
* User or System 'actions' are Events. The Browser creates a new Event-objects that handles that 'interactions' in a way that the DOM is awere of them.

3. What is an event listener?
* Listeners, or Handlers, are 'functions' that are invoked in response to Events. These listeners are attached to DOM-elements that await Events.

4. What is jQuery?
* Is a library that allow an easy DOM manipulation in cross browser fashion.

5. What is a component?
* Is a JS abstraction that allow us, as developers, to code reusable chunks of code.
