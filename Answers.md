1. The DOM is an object representation of our html elements. It allows us to manipulate elements that are in the html document. The DOM can be thought of as a tree. Each element on the tree is considered a node and can be manipulated. 

2. An event is an interaction with the DOM. It can be a click, double click, mouseover, etc.

3. An event listener is a method that is used to listen for a specific event. When that event is triggered the even listeners call back is ran and causes something to happen.

4. We convert NodeList into and array so that we can gain access to the array methods. Before NodeList are converted there's a limited amount of methods that can be used. After converting them we can then use methods such as map and filter

5. Components are building blocks that can be reused. They can make a page more dynamic without having to build out new features every time.
